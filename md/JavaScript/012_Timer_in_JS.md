### What are the characteristics of setTimeout, setInterval and requestAnimationFrame?

Timers are certainly（当然） essential（基本的） for asynchronous programming. Common timer functions include setTimeout, setInterval, and requestAnimationFrame（请求动画帧）. The most commonly used is setTimeout, and many people believe that the delay specified（指定的） in setTimeout dictates（规定） exactly when the function will execute.

In fact, this view is wrong, because JS is executed on a single thread. If the previous code affects the performance, it may result in setTimeout not executed as schedule（按计划）. Of course, setTimeout can be adjusted by code to make the timer relatively（相对地） more accurate（准确的）.

SetInterval is basically（基本上） the same as setTimeout, except that it executes a callback function at regular time intervals（固定时间间隔）. 

Generally, it is not recommended to use 'setInterval'. Firstly, similar to setTimeout, it cannot guarantee that the task will be executed exactly at the scheduled time（在预定时间） Secondly, it has an issue of execution accumulation（积累）.

In the browser environment, if a time-consuming（耗时的） operation occurs during timer execution, multiple callback functions may execute simultaneously（同时地） once the operation is completed, potentially leading to performance issues. 

If a looping timer is needed, it can effectively（有效地） be implemented using 'requestAnimationFrame'.

```javascript
function setInterval(callback, interval) {
  let timer
  const now = Date.now
  let startTime = now()
  let endTime = startTime
  const loop = () => {
    timer = window.requestAnimationFrame(loop)
    endTime = now()
    if (endTime - startTime >= interval) {
      startTime = endTime = now()
      callback(timer)
    }
  }
  timer = window.requestAnimationFrame(loop)
  return timer
}
let a = 0
setInterval(timer => {
  console.log(1)
  a++
  if (a === 3) cancelAnimationFrame(timer)
}, 1000)
```

With its intrinsic（固有的） throttling feature（节流功能）, 'requestAnimationFrame' can largely ensure only one execution within 16.6 milliseconds（毫秒）, provided that there are no frame drop issues. Moreover（并且）, this function's delay effect is highly accurate, without the common timing issues of other timers, and it can also be used to serve the purpose of setTimeout.
